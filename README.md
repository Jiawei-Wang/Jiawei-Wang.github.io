# This repo serves as personal Github Pages

## readme for COMP 120:

1. I successfully implemented all the paragraphs and images, however I tried to implement some desired effects using css and failed, so the homepage is plain and dull.
2. I did all the work by myself, however I read some templates before making my own.
3. Most of those templates used JS to implement interactive elements which are unnecessary and too complicated for me at this moment so I only used several basic elements in CSS.
4. I spent about 5 hours making this page.
5. Completion date: 06-02-2020

## next steps:

1. Finish COMP120
2. Rebuild this page using HTML/CSS/JS
3. Use personal URL and add link to resume
